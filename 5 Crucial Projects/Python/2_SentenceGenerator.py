2 - Sentence Generator:

Overview:

A series of different parts of sentences will be randomly
put together to come up with new interesting sentences.
What you will be Using:
Random, Integers, Print, Strings, Breaks, Functions, For, Range
My Thoughts on Project:
A very fun beginning project, have fun with this...
Come up with some wacky sentences!
Also, this project really gets you to experiment with strings,
piecing them together, randoming from a set of strings, and more.
