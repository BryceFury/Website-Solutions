Hackerrank - Python - Basic Data Types - Nested Lists

Let's implement a nested list! A nested list is a list that contains another list (i.e.: a list of lists). For example:

>> a = [['blue', 'green'], ['red', 'black'], ['blue', 'white']]
>> len(a)
3
>> a[1]
['red', 'black']
>> a[1][0]
red
To go through every element in a list, use a nested for loop.

Given the names and grades for each student in a Physics class of NN students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the same grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, NN, the number of students.
The 2N2N subsequent lines describe each student over 22 lines; the first line contains a student's name, and the second line contains their grade.

Constraints

2≤N≤52≤N≤5
There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade.
Output Format

Print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade in Physics; if there are multiple students, order their names alphabetically and print each one on a new line.
