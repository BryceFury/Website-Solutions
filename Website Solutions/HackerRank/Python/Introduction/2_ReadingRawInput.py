Hackerrank - Python - Introduction - Raw Input

Let's look at Python's input reading method.

>>> name = raw_input("Hey what's your name?\n")
Hey what's your name?
R2D2
>>> print name
R2D2
That's one way of doing it for yourself. However, we don't ask questions in competitive programming, we answer them! We will only use raw_input() to read a string without asking any questions to the system.

Task
Read a string from the console and print it.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains a string.

Constraints
String length â‰¤ 500

Output Format
Print the same string back.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

STDOUT = raw_input()

print STDOUT
