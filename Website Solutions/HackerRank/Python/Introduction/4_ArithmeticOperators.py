Hackerrank - Python - Introduction - Arithmetic Operators

Let's learn about Python's arithmetic operators.

First, let's read two integers:

a = int(raw_input())
b = int(raw_input())
The three basic arithmetic operators are the following:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
(We'll learn about division in the next task.)

Task
Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, aa. The second line contains the second integer, bb.

Constraints
1≤a≤10101≤a≤1010
1≤b≤10101≤b≤1010

Output Format
Print the three lines as explained above.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

STDFIR = int(raw_input())
STDSEC = int(raw_input())

print STDFIR + STDSEC
print STDFIR - STDSEC
print STDFIR * STDSEC
