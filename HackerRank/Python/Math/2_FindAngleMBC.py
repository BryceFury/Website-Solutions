Hackerrank - Python - Math - Find Angle MBC

ABCABC is a right triangle, 90°90° at BB.
Therefore, ∡ABC=90°∡ABC=90°.

Point MM is the midpoint of hypotenuse ACAC.

You are given the lengths ABAB and BCBC.
Your task is to find ∡MBC∡MBC (angle θ°θ°, as shown in the figure) in degrees.

Input Format

The first line contains the length of side ABAB.
The second line contains the length of side BCBC.

Constraints

0<AB≤1000<AB≤100
0<BC≤1000<BC≤100
Lengths ABAB and BCBC are natural numbers.

Output Format

Output ∡MBC∡MBC in degrees.

Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer.

NOTE: Python 3 is disabled for this challenge.
